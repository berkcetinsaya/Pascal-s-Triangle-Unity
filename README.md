# Pascal's Triangle on Unity

We (me, [Reese](https://github.com/satchelfrost) and [Ahmed](https://github.com/ahmedmansour3548)) just wanted to recreate the [example](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/Pascal%27s_Triangle_animated_binary_rows.gif) we saw on the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_triangle) of the Pascal's Triangle as a fun activity.

_Each frame represents a row in Pascal's triangle. Each column of pixels is a number in binary with the least significant bit at the bottom. Light pixels represent ones and the dark pixels are zeroes._
